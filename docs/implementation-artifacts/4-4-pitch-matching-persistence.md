# Story 4.4: Pitch Matching Persistence

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a musician,
I want my pitch matching results to persist and feed into my perceptual profile on app launch,
so that my matching accuracy is tracked over time and survives page refreshes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the IndexedDB adapter **When** `fetch_all_pitch_matchings()` is called **Then** all `PitchMatchingRecord`s are returned from the `pitch_matching_records` store sorted by timestamp ascending (FR37).

2. **Given** pitch matching records exist in IndexedDB **When** the app launches **Then** all records are replayed through `profile.update_matching(note, user_cent_error.abs())` during hydration, so the Profile view shows accurate pitch matching statistics (FR18, FR21).

3. **Given** a pitch matching record has an invalid MIDI note value **When** hydration processes that record **Then** it is skipped (not crash) and a warning is logged, matching the comparison hydration pattern.

4. **Given** a storage write fails during pitch matching **When** the error occurs **Then** the user is informed via the existing error notification (NFR8) **And** training continues.

5. **Given** the app launches with both comparison and pitch matching records **When** hydration completes **Then** the profile contains accurate data from both record types and `is_profile_loaded` is set to `true` only after both are processed.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement `fetch_all_pitch_matchings()` in IndexedDB adapter (AC: #1)
  - [ ] 1.1 Add `pub async fn fetch_all_pitch_matchings(&self) -> Result<Vec<PitchMatchingRecord>, StorageError>` to `IndexedDbStore`
  - [ ] 1.2 Mirror `fetch_all_comparisons()` exactly: open readonly transaction on `PITCH_MATCHING_STORE`, query via `TIMESTAMP_INDEX`, deserialize each record
- [ ] Task 2: Add pitch matching hydration to `app.rs` (AC: #2, #3, #5)
  - [ ] 2.1 After comparison hydration block, add `store.fetch_all_pitch_matchings().await`
  - [ ] 2.2 For each record: `MIDINote::try_new(record.reference_note)` with skip-on-invalid (same pattern as comparisons)
  - [ ] 2.3 Call `prof.update_matching(note, record.user_cent_error.abs())` for each valid record
  - [ ] 2.4 Log skipped count and total hydrated count
- [ ] Task 3: Verify end-to-end (AC: #4, #5)
  - [ ] 3.1 `cargo test -p domain` — confirm no regressions
  - [ ] 3.2 `trunk build` — confirm WASM compilation
  - [ ] 3.3 `cargo clippy` — zero warnings
  - [ ] 3.4 Manual browser test: do pitch matching, refresh page, verify profile stats persist

## Dev Notes

### Scope — This Is a Very Small Story

Story 4.3 already implemented the bulk of pitch matching persistence infrastructure. This story completes the **read path** — fetching records and replaying them during profile hydration. Only two files need modification, each with ~20 lines of new code.

### What Already Exists (DO NOT Rebuild)

| Component | File | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| `pitch_matching_records` IndexedDB store | `web/src/adapters/indexeddb_store.rs` | DB v2, exists |
| `save_pitch_matching()` | `web/src/adapters/indexeddb_store.rs:105-130` | Complete |
| `PitchMatchingDataStoreObserver` | `web/src/bridge.rs:114-152` | Wired and working |
| `PitchMatchingRecord` + `from_completed()` | `domain/src/records.rs:57-95` | Complete with tests |
| `profile.update_matching()` | `domain/src/profile.rs:192-200` | Complete with tests |
| Profile view matching stats display | `web/src/components/profile_view.rs:123-153` | Complete |
| Storage error notification | `web/src/components/pitch_matching_view.rs:541-554` | Complete |
| `delete_all()` clears both stores | `web/src/adapters/indexeddb_store.rs:167-193` | Complete |
| `TrainingDataStore` trait with both signatures | `domain/src/ports.rs:75-81` | Complete |

### Task 1: fetch_all_pitch_matchings() — Mirror Existing Pattern

Copy `fetch_all_comparisons()` (lines 132-165 in `indexeddb_store.rs`) and change:
- Store constant: `COMPARISON_STORE` → `PITCH_MATCHING_STORE`
- Record type: `ComparisonRecord` → `PitchMatchingRecord`
- Method name: `fetch_all_comparisons` → `fetch_all_pitch_matchings`

Everything else is identical — same transaction mode, same index query, same deserialization loop.

```rust
pub async fn fetch_all_pitch_matchings(&self) -> Result<Vec<PitchMatchingRecord>, StorageError> {
    let transaction = self
        .db
        .transaction_with_str_and_mode(PITCH_MATCHING_STORE, IdbTransactionMode::Readonly)
        .map_err(|e| StorageError::ReadFailed(format!("{e:?}")))?;

    let store = transaction
        .object_store(PITCH_MATCHING_STORE)
        .map_err(|e| StorageError::ReadFailed(format!("{e:?}")))?;

    let index = store
        .index(TIMESTAMP_INDEX)
        .map_err(|e| StorageError::ReadFailed(format!("{e:?}")))?;

    let request = index
        .get_all()
        .map_err(|e| StorageError::ReadFailed(format!("{e:?}")))?;

    let result = idb_request_to_future(request)
        .await
        .map_err(|e| StorageError::ReadFailed(format!("{e:?}")))?;

    let array: js_sys::Array = result.unchecked_into();
    let mut records = Vec::with_capacity(array.length() as usize);

    for i in 0..array.length() {
        let value = array.get(i);
        let record: PitchMatchingRecord = serde_wasm_bindgen::from_value(value)
            .map_err(|e| StorageError::ReadFailed(format!("Deserialization: {e}")))?;
        records.push(record);
    }

    Ok(records)
}
```

### Task 2: Pitch Matching Hydration — Add After Comparison Hydration

In `web/src/app.rs`, inside the `spawn_local` block, after the comparison hydration `match` block (around line 89) but **before** `db_store.set(Some(store))` (line 91):

```rust
// Pitch matching hydration
match store.fetch_all_pitch_matchings().await {
    Ok(records) => {
        let mut prof = profile_for_hydration.borrow_mut();
        let mut skipped = 0u32;

        for record in &records {
            let note = match MIDINote::try_new(record.reference_note) {
                Ok(n) => n,
                Err(_) => {
                    skipped += 1;
                    continue;
                }
            };

            prof.update_matching(note, record.user_cent_error.abs());
        }

        if skipped > 0 {
            log::warn!(
                "Skipped {skipped} pitch matching records with invalid MIDI note values during hydration"
            );
        }
        log::info!(
            "Profile pitch matching hydrated from {} records",
            records.len() - skipped as usize
        );
    }
    Err(e) => {
        log::error!("Failed to fetch pitch matching records for hydration: {e}");
    }
}
```

**Critical notes:**
- The `profile_for_hydration` borrow from comparison hydration is **already dropped** by this point (it's inside a separate `match` arm scope), so re-borrowing is safe.
- Pitch matching hydration only updates the profile — it does NOT feed into `TrendAnalyzer` or `ThresholdTimeline` (those track comparison training only).
- `user_cent_error` field on `PitchMatchingRecord` is a signed `f64`; pass `.abs()` to `update_matching()`.

### Project Structure Notes

Files to modify:
- `web/src/adapters/indexeddb_store.rs` — add `fetch_all_pitch_matchings()` method
- `web/src/app.rs` — add pitch matching hydration block

No new files. No Cargo.toml changes. No new dependencies.

## Previous Story Intelligence

### From Story 4.3 (Pitch Matching Training UI)
- PitchMatchingDataStoreObserver saves records to IndexedDB on every completed attempt — write path works
- PitchMatchingSession calls `profile.update_matching()` directly in `commit_pitch()` — no separate ProfileObserver needed (avoids double-counting)
- IndexedDB upgraded to v2 with `pitch_matching_records` object store and timestamp index
- `delete_all()` already clears both comparison_records and pitch_matching_records
- Storage error notification auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- All 293 domain tests pass, trunk build and clippy clean

### From Story 4.3 Debug Log
- Document-level Enter/Space handler was removed (unreachable, passed wrong value)
- `let _ = adjust_frequency()` replaced with proper error logging per project rules
